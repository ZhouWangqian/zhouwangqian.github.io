### **Facts and opinions**

My name 望千 literally translates to **"looking toward the millennium"**, or figuratively, **"approaching the millennium"**, because I was born in the final month of 1999.

I live and enjoy living a multilingual life.
+ Most of the time, my spoken English resembles a Southern British accent. But don't get me wrong. I have zero intention to sound posh in any way.
+ I speak multiple varieties of **Xiang** (Changsha and Lower Ningxiang) and **Mandarin** (Plastic Mandarin, Standard Mandarin, and Changde Mandarin).
+ I know a bit of **Cantonese**, **Spanish**, and **Portuguese**, but still need to work hard before I can fluently communicate with people.

I advocate for both **language preservation** and **multilingualism**. 
+ People should pass on local dialects to younger generations and avoid disparaging their attainment, especially within the context of linguistic unification (eg., the promotion of Standard Mandarin as a lingua franca) and globalisation. 
+ People should recognise the value of hybrid/contact languages, such as Plastic Mandarin, in fostering social bonding and cultural identity. 
+ Multilingual competence should benefit both individuals and societies.
